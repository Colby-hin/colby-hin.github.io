# Azure Cloud Detection Lab

## Overview
In this project, I set up **Azure Sentinel (SIEM)** and configured it to detect malicious activity inside a cloud environment.  
This lab demonstrates my skills in log collection, threat detection, and incident response.

---

## Objectives
- Deploy a Windows VM in Azure
- Connect VM logs to Azure Log Analytics
- Set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM)
- Create detection rules for suspicious activity
- Investigate alerts using KQL queries
- Develope an attack map dashboard showing attacker geolocations

---

## Steps

### 1. Deploying the VM
I created a Windows VM inside Azure and enabled logging.

---

### 2. Connecting Logs
I connected the VM to **Azure Log Analytics Workspace** and verified event logs were being ingested.

### 3. Configuring Sentinel
Enabled **Azure Sentinel** on the workspace and created custom analytics rules.

### 4. Detection Testing
I simulated brute force login attempts on the VM. Sentinel generated alerts as expected.

### 5. Building the Attack Map
I created a geolocation based **attack map** in Azure Sentinel to visualize where incoming attacks originated.

## Results
- Successfully ingested logs from VM â†’ Sentinel.  
- Created detection rules for failed RDP logins.  
- Queried and investigated alerts with **KQL**.
